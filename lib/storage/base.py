class BlockDev(object):
  """Block device abstract class.

  A block device can be in the following states:
    - not existing on the system, and by `Create()` it goes into:
    - existing but not setup/not active, and by `Assemble()` goes into:
    - active read-write and by `Open()` it goes into
    - online (=used, or ready for use)

  A device can also be online but read-only, however we are not using
  the readonly state (LV has it, if needed in the future) and we are
  usually looking at this like at a stack, so it's easier to
  conceptualise the transition from not-existing to online and back
  like a linear one.

  The many different states of the device are due to the fact that we
  need to cover many device types:
    - logical volumes are created, lvchange -a y $lv, and used
    - drbd devices are attached to a local disk/remote peer and made primary

  A block device is identified by three items:
    - the /dev path of the device (dynamic)
    - a unique ID of the device (static)
    - it's major/minor pair (dynamic)

  Not all devices implement both the first two as distinct items. LVM
  logical volumes have their unique ID (the pair volume group, logical
  volume name) in a 1-to-1 relation to the dev path. For DRBD devices,
  the /dev path is again dynamic and the unique id is the pair (host1,
  dev1), (host2, dev2).

  You can get to a device in two ways:
    - creating the (real) device, which returns you
      an attached instance (lvcreate)
    - attaching of a python instance to an existing (real) device

  The second point, the attachment to a device, is different
  depending on whether the device is assembled or not. At init() time,
  we search for a device with the same unique_id as us. If found,
  good. It also means that the device is already assembled. If not,
  after assembly we'll have our correct major/minor.

        correctly for their children
      - calling this method on an existing, in-use device is safe
